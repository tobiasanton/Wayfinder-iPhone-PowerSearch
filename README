This is the repository for the Wayfinder PowerSearch client for iPhone.
The client has earlier been released on App store but was later replaced bye Locate.
It is released under the BSD license.

To build the client you will also need to download the repository for Wayfinder-S60-Navigator, since the client shares the map engine with the S60 Navigator client.

For more information about the source code and how to build it, please go to oss.wayfinder.com
